# UI Assesment

## Overview

This focuses on the design and functionality of a user interface for managing brands. Users can search, sort, and filter items in the table, and the main area content changes dynamically based on the sidebar menu selection. The sidebar menu allows users to navigate between different sections such as development, design, and marketing. Additionally, users can click on folders to expand and view their subfolders. The app is also responsive, with the sidebar collapsing and displaying via a hamburger menu on small devices.

## Key Features

- Search Users can search for items in the table using the search bar.
- Sort and Filter Items in the table can be sorted and filtered based on various criteria.
- Dynamic Content The main area content changes based on the sidebar menu selection.
- Sidebar Menu Allows users to navigate between different sections such as development, design, and marketing.
- Folder Navigation Users can click on folders to expand and view their subfolders.
- Responsive Design The app is responsive, with the sidebar collapsing and displaying via a hamburger menu on small devices.

## Why React

I chose React for this project because of its fast working nature, easy routing, and seamless handling of dynamic content. React's efficient virtual DOM implementation enables rapid development, while React Router simplifies navigation within the application. Additionally, React's component-based architecture makes it easy to create and manage dynamic content, allowing for a more flexible and interactive user experience.
